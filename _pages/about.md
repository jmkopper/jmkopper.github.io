I am a postdoc in the Penn State University math department. I completed my Ph.D. in 2019 at UIC under the supervision of Izzet Coskun. I was a math major at UChicago before that.

Some projects on my github:
- A [CTA bus tracker](https://github.com/jmkopper/CTA-tracker) written in Go. See [here](https://sheltered-brushlands-30501.herokuapp.com/) for a demo (also [here](https://sheltered-brushlands-30501.herokuapp.com/search.html) for a different UI)
- A [simple HTML+js app for making graphs](https://github.com/jmkopper/graph-maker)
- A script for [converting GPS](https://github.com/jmkopper/gpx-to-csv-converter) data recorded in a .gpx file to an easier-to-use .csv.
- Various [implementations of algorithms](https://github.com/jmkopper/math) used in Schubert calculus. See [this paper](https://jmkopper.github.io/publication/grassmannians) for an explanation.

I like distance running, trail running, ultramarthon running, and mountain running. Here's my [Strava profile](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2853118).
