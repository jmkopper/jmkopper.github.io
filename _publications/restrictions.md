title: "Stability conditions for restrictions of vector bundles on projective surfaces"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/restrictions
excerpt: 'Using Bridgeland stability conditions, we give sufficient criteria for a stable vector bundle on a smooth complex projective surface to remain stable when restricted to a curve. We give a stronger criterion when the vector bundle is a general vector bundle on the plane. As an application, we compute the cohomology of such bundles for curves that lie in the plane or on Hirzebruch surfaces.'
