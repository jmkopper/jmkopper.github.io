collection: publications
permalink: /publication/grassmannians
excerpt: 'In this paper we study the pseudoeffective cones of blow-ups of Grassmannians at sets of points. For small numbers of points, the cones are often spanned by proper transforms of Schubert classes. In some special cases, we provide sharp bounds for when the Schubert classes fail to span and we describe the resulting geometry.'
