The source code for this post is available on my [github](https://github.com/jmkopper/CTA-tracker).

This post describes creating a simple bus tracker using Go, JavaScript, and MongoDB. I chose Go for this project for two reasons: (1) I wanted to learn it, and (2) Go is great for making razor-thin HTTP servers and I wanted to make something with minimal dependencies.

The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) has a [reasonably robust API](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/) for tracking buses (and trains and stuff). API calls are authenticated by an API key, which you have to request manually through a form. They sent me one about an hour after I asked for it.

For this project I made two different user interfaces. The first, which I'll call UI A, copies the style of many existing bus trackers, including the [CTA's own](http://www.ctabustracker.com/bustime/home.jsp). You select a route, then a direction, then a stop. The app then displays estimated arrival times at that stop. The other UI, UI B, uses a search bar to match stop descriptions. You click on the stop of your choice and a list of predicted arrival times populates next to it.

They look like this:

*UI A*

<img src="/images/UI_B.png" alt="UI B" width="400px"/>
*UI B*

You can try them on my heroku demo page: [UI A](https://sheltered-brushlands-30501.herokuapp.com) [UI B](https://sheltered-brushlands-30501.herokuapp.com/search.html)


### Building the HTTP server

Making an HTTP server in Go is ridiculously easy. Because my muxing needs were minimal, I used the built-in ServeMux. Here's the entirety of the server code

<pre lang="go">
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	config := readConfig()

	// create the request handlers
	ctah := ctaReqHandler{config: &config }
	mongoh := mongoSearchHandler{config: &config}
	staticFileServer := http.FileServer(http.Dir("static"))

	mux.Handle("/getCTAData", ctah)
	mux.Handle("/search", mongoh)
	mux.Handle("/", staticFileServer)

	listenAt := fmt.Sprintf(":%d", config.port)
	log.Printf("Open the following URL in the browser: http://localhost:%d\n", config.port)
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(listenAt, mux))
}
</pre>

Of course, there's some code for the two different request handlers too.

### Building UI A

To build UI A, it's a little static HTML/JavaScript and some HTTP methods. Basically, there's a generic fetch request maker called `postRequest` (because I'll only be making POST queries to the server). A POST request is then made by a function like

```javascript
async function getDirections(routeID) {
    let postData = {
        reqType: "getdirections",
        rt: routeID
    };
    let ctaResponse = await postRequest("/getCTAData", postData);
    let directions = ctaResponse["bustime-response"].directions;
    console.log(directions);
    updateDirections(directions);
}
```

The above sends two pieces of data to the server: a `reqType` denoting the request type, and the data required to make that request. In this case, it's asking the server to provide the directions of travel of a given route, where the route is specified by a `routeID`. This is handled on the Go server by converting the request into something understandable by the CTA API:

```go
func ctaGetRequest(ctaResponse chan<- map[string]interface{}, args CTAPostRequest, config *configSettings) {
	// ...
  // format the correct URL
	getUrl := fmt.Sprintf("http://ctabustracker.com/bustime/api/v2/%s?key=%s%s&format=json", args.ReqType, config.apiKey, affix)
  // ...
	// read the response
	body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
	}
	// pass the response to the ctaResponse channel
	var jsonResponse map[string]interface{}
	json.Unmarshal(body, &jsonResponse)
	ctaResponse <- jsonResponse
}
```

This response then gets transmitted back to the JS frontend by the muxer.

### Building UI B
I sort of prefer UI B, because in typical use cases for bus trackers, you already know the stop you want to track buses at. The reason UI A is popular in existing apps is that it cuts down on the amount of data the API needs to send you. There are over 11,000 CTA bus stops, but a given route will have fewer than 100 in either direction. On the other hand, this interface is unintuitive, particularly because you have to choose a direction which you may not even know. Finally, the bus stop names are alphabetized, but it's hard to predict which cross street comes first. You may waste time looking for <i>56th St. & Hyde Park Blvd.</i> when the stop is actually called <i>Hyde Park Blvd. & 56th St.</i> So a search bar makes sense.

Unfortunately, the CTA API doesn't provide a way to make searches, so we have to do it on our own. Fortunately, they do provide "General Transit Feed Specification data," which is [freely available](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/gtfs/). The `stops.txt` file is a JSON-formatted file containing stop names, descriptions, ID numbers, etc. MongoDB was all too happy to import this file and so I ran an Atlas database with a "stops" collection containing all the stops data. I also added a text search to the database for all fields. Finally, I hooked up the HTTP server.

For this we need the [MongoDB driver for Go](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/), which is the only real dependency the app has. Once the user has typed at least 3 characters into the search bar (to limit the number of search results), the app makes the search request

```go
	// formulate the search filter
	filter := bson.M{
		"$text": bson.M{
			"$search": queryString,
		},
	}
	// sort by "textScore"
	opts := options.Find().SetSort(bson.M{
		"score": bson.M{
			"$meta": "textScore",
		},
	})
	cursor, err := stopsCollection.Find(context.TODO(), filter, opts)
```
MongoDB then responds with a list of stops. Now when a user types in the search bar, an HTTP request is triggered, passing the text of their search as the `queryString` to the Go server. Go makes the above query through the Mongo driver, and then passes the results back to JavaScript through the HTTP response. JavaScript then draws those stops in a table. When a user clicks on a row, an HTTP request is made, reusing the code from UI A, to CTA API via the Go server.

A final note: to deploy this to Heroku, you have to give the app's IP address access to Mongo. Unfortunately, you have to pay real money for static IP adresses, so as a workaround the database is open to all IP addresses. Probably not ideal from a security standpoint.
