Analyzing a broken GPS watch with pandas
======

The COROS APEX watch I bought last November was broken. Industry standard GPS watches make a recording once every second and log it to a .gpx file, but mine wasn't doing that. Sometimes it was logging every second, sometimes it wasn't. Each log entry looks something like this:

`<trkpt lat="41.8001709" lon="-87.5809939">
        <ele>182</ele>
        <time>2022-01-06T18:30:03Z</time>
        <extensions>
          <heartrate>0</heartrate>
          <distance>1113</distance>
          <cadence>0</cadence>
        </extensions>
      </trkpt>`
